# Ising-Model-Simulation

This repo contains code and a report that I submitted for my MATH 575 course on Statistical Computation. For this project, I utilized the Metropolis-Hastings algorithm to simulate the Ising model. As someone without a physics background, this was a challenging but highly rewarding experience.
